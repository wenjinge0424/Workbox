On an auction style format, Workbox creates a competition style platform for “workers” also know as the “bidders” to place a bid on jobs you create. When the competition gets heavy you save money. Jobs are displayed by categories of job fields. These job fields include Construction, Auto Mechanic, Daycare, Gardening, Ride Sharing, Plumbing, Electrical and so on. Bidders within their field of expertise will place a bid on jobs you post to the application. Some jobs will be instantly available and others will have a time allotment. The more aggressive the bidder is, the lower the cost of labor becomes for the “employer” also know as the “job creator”. These jobs that were once offered to larger companies to complete, become available to people that are out of work or looking for extra income. Jobs will be displayed using a radius by miles within or outside of your city.</p><br><p>Today jobs are harder to come by then years ago when the economy was thriving and employers needed more man power to fulfill the requirements of consumers. Filling out job applications and waiting for a phone call becomes tiresome, in a world where the rising cost of living outweighs the standard paycheck, that often stays dormant. More often than not we find ourselves needing more than one job to cover priorities. For “employers” finding someone at the right price at the right time will soon be available at the click of a button.</p>";
